abstract = {In recent years, the usefulness of affect detection for educational software has become clear. Accurate detection of student affect can support a wide range of interventions with the potential to improve student affect, increase engagement, and improve learning. In addition, accurate detection of student affect could play an essential role in research attempting to understand the root causes and impacts of different forms of affect. However, current approaches to affect detection have largely relied upon sensor systems, which are expensive and typically not physically robust to classroom conditions, reducing their potential real-world impact. Work towards sensor-free affect detection has produced detectors that are better than chance, but not substantially better— especially when subject to stringent cross-validation processes. In this paper we present models which can detect student engaged concentration, confusion, frustration, and boredom solely from students' interactions within a Cognitive Tutor for Algebra. These detectors are designed to operate solely on the information available through students’ semantic actions within the interface, making these detectors applicable both for driving interventions and for labeling existing log files in the PSLC DataShop, facilitating future discovery with models analyses at scale.},

The recent advent of public educational data repositories has made it feasible for researchers to investigate a wide variety of scientific questions using data mining. In this article, five categories of educational data mining methods are discussed, as well as the key applications for which educational data mining methods have been used.},

abstract = {Feedback is one of the most powerful influences on learning and achievement, but this impact can be either positive or negative. Its power is frequently mentioned in articles about learning and teaching, but surprisingly few recent studies have systematically investigated its meaning. This article provides a conceptual analysis of feedback and reviews the evidence related to its impact on learning and achievement. This evidence shows that although feedback is among the major influences, the type of feedback and the way it is given can be differentially effective. A model of feedback is then proposed that identifies the particular properties and circumstances that make it effective, and some typically thorny issues are discussed, including the timing of feedback and the effects of positive and negative feedback. Finally, this analysis is used to suggest ways in which feedback can be used to enhance its effectiveness in classrooms.

The cross-fertilization of both areas is still in its infancy, and even academic references are scarce on the ground, although some leading education-related publications are already beginning to pay attention to this new field. In order to offer a reasonable organization of the available bibliographic information according to different criteria, firstly, and from the Data Mining practitioner point of view, references are organized ac- cording to the type of modeling techniques used, which include: Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Clustering and Visualization Methods, Fuzzy Logic, Intelligent agents, and Inductive Reasoning, amongst others. From the same point of view, the information is organized according to the type of Data Mining problem dealt with: clustering, classification, predi- ction, etc. Finally, from the standpoint of the e-learning practitioner, we provide a taxonomy of e-learning problems to which Data Mining tech- niques have been applied, including, for instance: Students’ classification based on their learning performance; detection of irregular learning behaviors; e-learning system navigation and interaction optimization; clus- tering according to similar e-learning system usage; and systems’ adapta- bility to students’ requirements and capacities.},

abstract = {Online social networks pose an interesting problem: how to best characterize the different classes of user behavior. Tra- ditionally, user behavior characterization methods, based on user individual features, are not appropriate for online net- working sites. In these environments, users interact with the site and with other users through a series of multi- ple interfaces that let them to upload and view content, choose friends, rank favorite content, subscribe to users and do many other interactions. Different interaction patterns can be observed for different groups of users. In this paper, we propose a methodology for characterizing and identifying user behaviors in online social networks. First, we crawled data fromYouTube and used a clustering algorithmto group users that share similar behavioral pattern. Next, we have shown that attributes that stem from the user social inter- actions, in contrast to attributes relative to each individual user, are good discriminators and allow the identification of relevant user behaviors. Finally, we present and discuss ex- perimental results of the use of proposed methodology. A set of useful profiles, derived from the analysis of the YouTube sample is presented. The identification of different classes of user behavior has the potential to improve, for instance, recommendation systems for advertisements in online social networks.},

abstract = {On-line discussion forums constitute communities of people learning from each other, which not only inform the students about their peers' doubts and problems but can also inform instructors about their students' knowledge of the course contents. In fact, nowadays there is increasing interest in the use of discussion forums as an indicator of student performance. In this respect, this paper proposes the use of different data mining approaches for improving prediction of students' final performance starting from participation indicators in both quantitative, qualitative and social network forums. Our objective is to determine how the selection of instances and attributes, the use of different classification algorithms and the date when data is gathered affect the accuracy and comprehensibility of the prediction. A new Moodle's module for gathering forum indicators was developed and different executions were carried out using real data from 114 university students during a first-year course in computer science. A representative set of traditional classification algorithms have been used and compared versus classification via clustering algorithms for predicting whether students will pass or fail the course on the basis of data about their forum usage. The results obtained indicate the suitability of performing both a final prediction at the end of the course and an early prediction before the end of the course; of applying clustering plus class association rules mining instead of traditional classification for obtaining highly interpretable student performance models; and of using a subset of attributes instead of all available attributes, and not all forum messages but only students' messages with content related to the subject of the course for improving classification accuracy. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
